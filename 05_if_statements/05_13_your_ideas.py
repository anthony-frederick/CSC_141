# This comment talks about how creating lists will help me in the future

'''
With the ability to create lists I will be able to do a lot more with coding
websites and storing user data and information in them. Creating databases
will also be eaiser and after I learned all those things in chapter 5 I will
more easily be able to sort the data in different ways. The fact that I can
store and pick certain data would also be helpful for writing games with 
player data. With this stuff I learned I could even code a virtual menu
type thing at a restaraunt or supermarket so people can just send in their
food orders.
