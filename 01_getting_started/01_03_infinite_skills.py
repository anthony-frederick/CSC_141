If I had infinite knowledge of coding I would definitely start off by 
making a really well made game so I would be able to make some money from 
coding. I would want the game to be some kind of fps game or a puzzle game 
that takes multiple people to finish.

I could also make a program that could generate anything you asked 
for like chatgpt but with infinite coding experience it would be able to 
make it much better. I could possibly add other features to it as well 
other than just text.

Another cool program I would make is an art tool with tons of different 
options for doing different types of art. 
I would want to include the ability to just draw and erase with other 
staple features of an art program like filling in things or increasing the pen size. 
I would even maybe include an ai art type thing to make it a little easier 
for newer people.

The last program I would make would be a program that 
can detect whether or not there are viruses in the system that is running 
the program so I can help people who are in trouble. I have had some problems 
with viruses in the past and something like that would have helped.
